# Diabetes Model 
This model uses the publicly available Kaggle [Diabetes data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set) as a base to serve as an example for how ModelOp Center can enable comprehensive Governance and Monitoring for a Healthcare related model. Note that it has been modified synthetically to include Gender as a protected class, purely for demonstration purposes.
